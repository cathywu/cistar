# Decentralized Reinforcement Learning Traffic Light Control

DQN branch contains the code for multi-agent DQN controlled intelligent traffic lights.

Currently DQN branch has been approved by the original Flow community and waiting to be merged.

For detailed changes compared to original Flow code, please refer to the [PR](https://github.com/flow-project/flow/pull/964)
